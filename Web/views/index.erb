    <h1>First Practice Ruby website integration</h1>
    <p>
      In this first practice, we will connect an
      HTML form to Ruby code and then process the
      submitted data to display a customized output in a new tab. <br>

      For the backend, we will call the hello action using the POST
      method declared in the app.rb file. In this action, we retrieve
      the user's name and birth date from the form fields. Then, we calculate
      the user's age to determine if they are of legal age and display the result
      on a new page located at /hello in the views directory.
    </p>
  </div>

  <form method="post" action="/hello">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Name" name="name" required>
    <input type="date" placeholder="Birth Date" name="birth" required>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</div>

  <h1>BMI Calculating with logical Ruby implementation</h1>
  <p>
    In this exercise, you will create a web form that asks the user for their weight
    (in kilograms) and height (in meters). When the user submits the form, your Ruby
    backend will receive the data using the POST method. Then, the server will calculate
    the user’s Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight / (height ** 2). Based
    on the result, the application will determine the user’s category (underweight, normal weight,
    overweight, or obese) and display a personalized message on a new page. <br>

    This exercise will help you practice using GET to show the form, POST to process the data,
    params to access user input, and ERB to dynamically show the results in the view.
